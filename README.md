Requirements

	Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
	All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
	All your files should end with a new line
	A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

	You are not allowed to use global variables
	No more than 5 functions per file
	You are allowed to use the standard library
	In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
	The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called binary_trees.h
	Don’t forget to push your header file
	All your header files should be include guarded

Data structures
	
	Please use the following data structures and types for binary trees. Don’t forget to include them in your header file.


Basic Binary Tree

	    int n;
	    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
	    struct binary_tree_s *left;
	    struct binary_tree_s *right;
	};

	typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;


Binary Search Tree
	
	typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t;

AVL Tree

	typedef struct binary_tree_s avl_t;

Note: For tasks 0 to 23 (included), you have to deal with simple binary trees. They are not BSTs, thus they don’t follow any kind of rule.

Print function

	To match the examples in the tasks, you are given this function
